This is the CAPP microcode for **POWER8** and **POWER9** systems.

This needs to be loaded into the CAPP unit on a POWER8 or POWER9 using
skiboot for a system to use CAPI.

Build script here formats the different ucodes into the hostboot SBE
format so that skiboot can parse them.

To build, do:

   ./build.sh

Which will create a single file cappucode.bin.

DEBUG env variable can also be set to know which ucode blobs are being
merged to generate the CAPP ucode blob.
